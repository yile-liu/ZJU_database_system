Since C is the primary key of r2, $r_1 \Join r_2$ will no be bigger than size of r1. So does $(r_1 \Join r_2) \Join r_3$. Therefore the final size is at most 1000.

An efficient atratergy for computing the join is computing $r_1 \Join r_2$ with primary index of r2 and then computing $\Join r_3$ with primary index of r3.

Size of result is:
$$
\frac{n_1\times n_2\times n_3}{V(E, r_2)\times V(E, r_3)} = \frac{1000\times 1500\times 750}{1100\times 100}\approx10227
$$
A good strategy is to compute $r_1\Join r_2$ first because the size of intermedia relation $r_2\Join r_3$ is bigger than that of this case.

Compute $\sigma_{(dept\_name="Music")\wedge(building<"Watson")}(department)$ at first with the index on (dept_name, building) on relation *department*. Then select the tuples with *budget<5500*.
